# PythonDataVisualization-PracticeLab

The tasks in this notebook have been developed based on examples from the IBM Data Visualization course and are documented for future reference and reusability.


Introduction
This notebook analyzes wildfire activities in Australia, focusing on various aspects of fire behavior and trends over time. The dataset used for the analysis contains historical records of wildfires starting from 2005. The objective is to leverage Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Folium to visualize and understand the patterns in fire activities.

Objectives:
Use visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium) to create informative plots and charts. Analyze variables such as estimated fire area, fire brightness, radiative power, and fire count in different regions of Australia.
